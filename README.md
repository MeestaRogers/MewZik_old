# MewZik
An application to manage your music library and jam your favorite hits. Will be cross-platform.

Mewzik is intended to be an open source alternative to other media players.
This includes music, movies, streaming services, and other modern media
capabilities.

GTK3/Glade (gtkmm) and SDL will be the primary libraries to support application development.
Linux is the initial target. Following Linux will be OSX and Windows.
Applying a similiar cross platform approach as gimp is the direction moving forward,
but things may change as time progresses.
